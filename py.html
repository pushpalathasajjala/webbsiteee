		<h2>What is Python? </h2>
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.<br><br>

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python.on itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective<br>


	<h3>What Is Python Used For?</h3>
<u>Web Development</u>
<p>Python is a go-to for complex web development projects, as its flexibility makes it possible to create sophisticated web utilities with relative ease. HTML and JavaScript are the primary languages for building the front end of a program. But you can use Python-based web frameworks like Django to smooth the process of handling backend or server-side functionality.<br>

Giant websites and platforms like YouTube and Google rely heavily on Python for critical infrastructure. This has further enhanced its reputation as a solid component in the web developer’s toolkit.</p>
<u>Calculators</u>
<p>Yes, you can learn to build a quality graphical user interface (GUI) calculator in Python with this tutorial. In fact, this is an excellent introduction to GUI programming and a solid starter Python project for beginners. Just be aware that it’ll help to have some previous coding experience before you attempt it.</p>

<u>Operating Systems</u>
<p>
You heard that right—Python is so robust that it can be used to build entire operating systems. The object-oriented design of this programming language makes large projects easier to manage. So, it’s completely reasonable to attempt a task this daunting with Python. Though building an operating system isn’t generally a popular Python undertaking, we thought it was interesting enough to mention.<br>

And speaking of operating systems, Python is compatible with virtually all of them! This means you can build native applications for both Windows and Mac computers with it. From a software development perspective, this is a dream come true.</p>

<u>Desktop Applications</u>
<p>
As mentioned above, Python is an excellent choice for desktop applications with a GUI. The Python Standard Library contains tools for quickly working up simple GUI desktop applications. But you can also code one from start to finish with Python.<br>

Popular applications such as Dropbox and BitTorrent are mostly written in Python, so it’s a proven language for this category of software engineering. This is what has drawn so much talent to Python programming. You can build something as large and complex as Dropbox with a single language. That means a lot of frustration is removed from the development process.</p>

<u>FinTech</u>
<p>
Python is becoming increasingly popular for its potential applications in the fintech realm. The reason for this popularity is Python’s usefulness in applications like data regulation, analytics, risk management, and quantitative rate problems. Further, there are tons of Python tools that make it the perfect language for fintech and other finance applications. Here are just a few examples:

<table border="1"><tr><th>NumPy
SciPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Cython
PyTables</th></tr></table></p>

<u>Mobile Apps</u>
<p>
Python is a go-to for many mobile app developers. And it’s just as useful on iOS and Android as it is on desktop operating systems. There’s a long list of mobile applications built using Python, and it’s getting longer every day. Popular programs like Instagram are mainly written in Python, so clearly it’s a great way to start off in mobile development.</p>

<u>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</u>
<p>
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have become buzzwords these days, but the truth is that it all comes down to algorithms, code, and logic. Given the scope and power of Python, it’s no surprise that some truly world-class tools exist for generating intelligent behavior in Python.<br>

Arguably the most popular is the ubiquitous machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. Speaking from experience, Sklearn makes the process of building everything from classifiers to regression models orders of magnitude simpler than it otherwise would be.<br>

If neural networks are more your jam, there’s always TensorFlow. Adding in the new Keras API, building a state-of-the-art neural network is easier than it has ever been.</p>

<u>Data Science</u>
<p>
Whether you’re doing straightforward data analysis or full-on data science, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better suite of tools than those in Python.<br>

The Pandas library is a quantum-leap improvement over the dusty Excel spreadsheets in which financial analysis was done for so long. If Pandas isn’t fast enough for you, most of the basic vector operations can be one with NumPy. Numpy also offers the ability to do linear algebra, scientific computing, and a host of other highly technical things. It is, therefore, a great tool to learn how to use well.</p>
